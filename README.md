 Akan Name Generator

Project Description
The   Akan Name Generator   is a simple web application that calculates the   day of the week   a user was born and assigns them a corresponding   Akan name   based on their   gender  .  
Akan names originate from   Ghanaian culture  , where children are named according to the day they were born. This project allows users to enter their date of birth, select their gender, and instantly discover their traditional Akan name.
